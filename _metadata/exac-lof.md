From Analysis of protein-coding genetic variation in 60,706 humans Lek et al.: " We have used this catalogue to calculate objective metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants,
and to identify genes subject to strong selection against various classes of mutation;
identifying 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of predicted protein-truncating variants,
with 72% of these genes having no currently established human disease phenotype."
